# CircleCI Auto-Fix Setup

This CircleCI workflow automatically fixes lint and format issues in your code.

## How It Works

1. Runs `npm run lint` and `npm run format` with autofix
2. If files were modified:
   - Commits changes with "Auto-fix: lint and format changes"
   - Pushes to the branch
   - **Fails the original build** (indicating fixes were applied)
   - A new CircleCI build is triggered, and should succeed
3. If no changes, build succeeds

## Setup Required

### 1. GitHub Token

Create a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope (or `public_repo` for public repos)

- Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) settings
- Click "Generate new token" and select "Fine-grained tokens"
- Configure token with required repository permissions

### 2. CircleCI Environment Variable

Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your CircleCI project settings
